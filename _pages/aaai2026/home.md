# Introduction

We are excited to announce the 3rd International Workshop on "**AI Governance Workshop: Alignment, Morality, Law, and Design**" (AIGOV) at the AAAI 2026, a critical event addressing the critical intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) governance, ethical alignment, and responsible deployment across autonomous systems. As AI technologies rapidly advance from generative models to sophisticated agentic systems capable of autonomous decision-making, new governance challenges emerge that existing frameworks cannot adequately address. This workshop brings together researchers, industry practitioners, and policy experts to develop actionable frameworks for safe, aligned, and accountable AI systems. Our unique focus combines technical governance mechanisms with policy integration, emphasizing "Governance by Design" approaches that embed responsibility directly into AI architectures rather than applying governance as external oversight.

**Format**: This workshop will be a hybrid event held in conjunction with [**AAAI 2026**](https://aaai.org/conference/aaai/aaai-26/), taking place on **January 26th, 2026** in Singapore. This full-day workshop combines keynote presentations, technical sessions, industry panels, and interactive discussions to provide a comprehensive overview of the topic. The format includes: opening keynote on governance principles, technical sessions on AI alignment and safety, industry panels sharing deployment experiences, lightning talks on technical solutions, poster sessions during breaks, interactive framework development, and collaborative roadmap development discussions. The workshop emphasizes practical outcomes through hands-on sessions and multi-stakeholder discussions that bridge the research, industry, and policy communities.

**Attendance**: Open to researchers, industry practitioners, policy experts, and students working on AI governance, safety, and responsible AI. Expected attendance: 120-150 participants (or as per AAAI guidance). We are looking forward to submissions on themes mentioned above, including novel governance challenges or practical implementation experiences.

# Call for Papers

We invite submissions addressing AI governance challenges, including:

- **Technical AI Governance**: Alignment methods, safety mechanisms, verification frameworks for autonomous systems.
- **Policy and Regulatory Frameworks**: Legal compliance, regulatory approaches for AI deployment, and international governance standards.
- **Ethical AI Implementation**: Bias mitigation, fairness, transparency, and accountability in AI decision-making.
- **Agentic AI Governance**: Governance frameworks specifically for autonomous decision-making systems.
- **Human-AI Collaboration**: Oversight models, collaborative approaches between humans and AI systems.
- **Industry Applications**: Case studies, deployment experiences, practical governance implementation.
- **Explainable AI**: Decision transparency, interpretability methods for governance compliance.
- **Multi-agent Coordination**: Governance mechanisms for multi-agent systems and distributed AI architectures.
- **Safety, Alignment, and Security Challenges**: Case studies, experiments, tools to address Governance, Evaluations, Monitoring, and Observability Challenges. 

**Submission Requirements**: Submissions should be in the form of a 5-page paper (+2-page references/appendix) for proceeding articles or a 2-page abstract for posters/demonstrations. All submissions should follow AAAI formatting guidelines. Accepted papers will be presented at the workshop and included in the workshop proceedings, unless the authors opt out. The review will be double-blind, so please keep your submission(s) anonymous. The accepted papers have the option to be non-archival (i.e., only hosted on the website). The non-archival papers can be relevant work presented or published in another venue or journal. 

All accepted papers and extended abstracts will be presented as posters. The program committee will select a few papers for oral presentation. There will be a poster session during the scheduled coffee breaks to facilitate and spark discussions amongst attendees. We look forward to your submissions and to seeing you at the workshop. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact the organizing committee. 

**Submission Site Information**: Please submit your work via **[**OpenReview**](https://openreview.net/group?id=AAAI.org/2026/Workshop/AIGOV)**.
